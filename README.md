## General Information

This is my version of a project idea from [40 JavaScript Projects for Beginners](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-projects-for-beginners/), Project #21. The project listed in [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) led you to a video coding along with Ania Kubow. I did not code along with Ania, but researched a variety of coding samples of a memory card games to develop how my card game would function. This card game has a timer that begins once you click on the opening screen. It checks for matching cards, that will remove pointer events and keep a two cards on screen if they are a match. There is a tally for each match found, and once all matches have been made it alerts the user that they have won, followed by a game reset. In addition, there is a reset button for the user to select should they want to beat their current time frame.

As a music educator, I chose to use images that I teach my students for this memory card game. Focusing on the treble clef lines and spaces and including middle c - which is a challenge for students when first learning these absolute note names.

## What I Learned

This project was challenging for me and I found the [Awesome Vanilla JavaScript Memory Card Game Tutorial with developedbyed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tlb4tv4mC4&t=2265s) to be very helpful in developing this game. The tutorial helped me in creating the card generator and breaking down the function to use `createElement` method for each card displayed on the grid, as well as the logic for each card. I learned about `pointerEvents` and utilizing them in both javascript and css.

## Continued Learning

I look forward to creating more JavaScript projects and strengthening my skills. Happy coding everyone!
